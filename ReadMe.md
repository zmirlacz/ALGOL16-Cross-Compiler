# ALGOL16-Cross-Compiler

##Short description
As an academic exercise I wrote a compiler for simple programming language called **ALGOL16**.

Compiler is written in **Prolog**, which provides very convenient concept for writing parsers called definite clause grammars.

##ALGOL16
* Documentation of language grammar can be found in doc folder.

##Machine code
* Code written in ALGOL16 is compiled to machine code of **Sextium III**. Sextium III is a virtual processor defined
for the purpose of this project.

* Documentation is in doc folder.

##TODO:

* Call by name/value
* Nesting procedures
* Recursive calls
